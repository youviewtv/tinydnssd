TinyDNSSD
=========

TinyDNSSD is a Java library for sending and receiving Multicast DNS packets to perform DNS Service
Discovery.

From Android 4.1, service discovery can be performed using the [NsdManager]. However some use cases
make use of the DNS TXT record to efficiently add extra key-value metadata, and Android has a
[bug] that causes the returned data to always be empty. This library can be used to work around this bug.

This library has an Android specific class, the `DiscoverResolver`, which still uses `NsdManager` to
leverage the system's already running discovery service, but will send another unicast query packet
in order to retrieve the TXT record. It also simplifies the API usage compared to calling `NsdManager`
directly.

Usage
-----

```java
DiscoverResolver resolver = new DiscoverResolver(context, "_androidtvremote._tcp",
    new DiscoverResolver.Listener() {
        @Override
        public void onServicesChanged(Map<String, MDNSDiscover.Result> services) {
            for (MDNSDiscover.Result result : services.values()) {
                // access the Bluetooth MAC from the TXT record
                String mac = result.txt.dict.get("bt");
                String name = result.srv.fqdn;
                Log.d(TAG, name + " -> " + mac);
            }
        }
    });
resolver.start();
```
